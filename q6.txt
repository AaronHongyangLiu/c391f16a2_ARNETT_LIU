The average runtime of both R-tree and Standard Index will increase as the side length increases.
For R-tree, the runtime increases a relatively large amount as the side length increases.
For Standard Index, the runtime increases a relatively small amount as the side length increases,
however, the average runtime of R-tree is always a lot better than the average runtime of Standard Index.
